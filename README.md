# DecentralisedLottery

* The goal of the project is a decentralised lottery to be created.
* Connecting with metamask is a must. 
* The application should use a stable coin like __USDT__, so that
the prize money doesn't change rapidly in the time of the accumulation of the money.
* The contracts should be very well optimised, so that less money is wasted on gas and more is proportionaly added to the lottery.
* Fronted is going to be written on vue.js
